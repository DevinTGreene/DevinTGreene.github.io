            <h2>The story so far</h2>
            <p>
                I pursed my education from my home here in the foothills of the Appalachian mountains. Aside from a
                deep
                interest and abiding love for technology and innovation, I also am deeply passionate about all
                things
                food, drink and hospitality. I've worked in several restaurants and hope to continue to expand my
                culinary skills for my entire lifetime. Additionally, I have a wide variety of automotive repair
                skills,
                earned through experience opening an automotive business with my father. I consider myself a life
                long
                weight lifter, and I hope my fitness habits keeps my mind and body sound for years to come. Working
                out
                cultivates my drive and spirit, and I hope to be able to use that drive to affect the world around
                me
                and other young athletes in
                a positive way, and fuel my desire to continue to self learn, pursue certifications, and acquire new
                skills in and out of the technology field. </p>
        </div>

        <div id='goals'>
            <h2> Goals and Aspirations</h2>
            <p>Currently, I am refreshing and expanding my technological skill set. In the forseeable future I hope to
                expand my skill set into the data science, specifically Machine Learning and Deep learning! I am hooked
                by the idea that these fields are often used for Astronomy and space exploration. Everyday the
                possibility of the idea that I could one day use my skills set to be involved in exploring the'Final
                Frontier' drives me to pursue Udemy courses and private projects to expand my skills. </p>

            <p>
                I am also extremely focused on producing projects and freelance work to demonstrate my full stack
                development or web developer skills. I know that these skills obtained through my education are the key
                to getting my foot into the door of the technology industry, the first crucial step in my dream
                mentioned above. I am viscously hungry to get my start, and I am determined to put in the work until
                (and after) I find my first position.

            Here are some examples of projects, both academic and personal that I have completed. Since I am working to
            enter the industry, these are mostly private projects, or sites I have designed for friends, family, or
            myself! This is my first website, and I consider it to still be a project still under construction, as
            expand my web development skills.

                    Follow the picture link to a web scraper that I built in C#. It is designed to scrape the Allmenu's
                    website
                    for
                    the names, prices, and descriptions off of a select number of menus in the city of Atlanta. This was
                    the
                    first personal project in a series of projects that I am using to attempting to break into Data
                    Science skills.
